I wasn’t planning to start this blog with something so personal—entries will be topical sometimes, of course, though not always this close to home—but bad things happened, I decided against posting something lengthy on social media, and here we are. Fair warning to you, dear reader, if this is a sensitive subject: information and opinions about a specific case of racism in the American south ahead. (I hope it goes without saying, but I will be doing the opposite of condoning said racism. Anyway.)

From 2010-2014, I was a student at Samford University in Birmingham, AL, studying for my undergraduate. Yesterday morning, an image of a t-shirt popped up on Twitter. This particular t-shirt was in commemoration of a formal event for one of Samford’s sorority chapters, Alpha Delta Pi. I’ll let the image speak for itself:

![A hand-drawn, old-looking map of Alabama that includes a horribly racist caricature of a black man eating a slice of watermelon and a group of slaves picking cotton. Yep.]({{ site.url }}/assets/alabama.jpg)

If it’s not abundantly clear, that is a caricatured black man eating a large slice of watermelon with a group of slaves picking cotton right above him. Allegedly, the Samford administration saw the design and immediately forbade the sorority from using it. Of course, ΑΔΠ proceeded to make shirts with the design anyway, because why not—everybody eats watermelon, right? Watermelon’s great. [No harm done](http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/12/how-watermelons-became-a-racist-trope/383529/).

Confusingly, the sorority’s president claims to have approved the shirt without looking closely at it—which, you know, she presumably would have then had to do when the university rejected it. Truth is hard. 

I first found out about this via an email Samford’s president sent to current students (I still know a few), but coverage is now on [Jezebel](http://jezebel.com/alabama-sorority-made-t-shirts-with-a-black-man-eating-1776518333), [Time](http://time.com/4330113/alpha-delta-pi-samford-university-t-shirt/), and [Cosmopolitan](http://www.cosmopolitan.com/college/news/a58389/samford-university-adpi-racist-formal-shirts/). And, also, local coverage is up at [al.com](http://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2016/05/alabama_university_apologizes.html)—just don’t read the comments on that story unless you want to drown your day in a pool of despair for the future of discourse and empathy.

Needless to say, yesterday was a sad and strange one for me. I’ll quickly acknowledge the frustration and anger—which I certainly have plenty of right now—and the cynicism—as, yes, given many of the peers I (had the misfortune to) know from my time as a student at Samford, this event is not surprising in the slightest.

The caliber of ignorance on display here—of a sort that not only casually holds such horribly backward and destructive beliefs, but is also so completely blind to the world outside of an extremely limited sphere of experience that such a colossally stupid decision doesn’t even seem to register as a thing that might, you know, ruffle some feathers, to say the very least—is, infuriatingly, the status quo for many people I knew.

Even understanding that, I chose to stay at Samford to the completion of my degree for a number of reasons, chief among them the handful of people I found who were nothing like those I just described. So, to a certain extent, I knew I was making my bed in this culture, at least for a time.

What’s crushingly sad to me, though, are the implications of this for those few good people, the people who quietly and doggedly work to make the university a more inclusive, progressive, diverse place.

They were and are there: in various (mostly, and unsurprisingly, small, but determined) student organizations fighting an indifferent student body for the inclusion of underrepresented groups in the mainstream of campus life, in the English department where I spent most of my time and was encouraged to read broadly and from as many perspectives as possible, in pockets of the administration that cared little for the board members and directly for the well-being of students of all types and backgrounds.

And then all it takes to make it feel like we’re back to square one, that all of those lovely peoples’ work to keep pushing Samford forward, however slowly, was useless, is a single fucking t-shirt made by and for a few selfish children.

Because when this kind of thing is picked up by widely-read, national media, all of that is lost. Samford becomes “that school where those sorority girls used racist stereotypes to promote their vacuous party of southern aristocratic decadence”—and there’s just no way around it (and it’s accurate).

I’m not at all saying that the media should change approach, as what they’re reporting is correct. Nor am I defending the university as a whole in a moment where the criticism leveled at it is absolutely deserved, or trying to draw attention away from the implicitly horrible things this event reveals about the campus culture.

Nor am I trying to ignore the real, most terrible fallout, which lands directly on the black community at Samford. Just trying to have a voice or feel even remotely at home within an already wealthy, overwhelmingly white, and historically racist campus is hard enough without being smacked across the face with something this dehumanizing.

It’s just very, very depressing that even a little foundational work toward a better future at a place already fraught with racial injustice and oppression can seem totally undone, or at least rolled much further back, in an instant. That’s all.
