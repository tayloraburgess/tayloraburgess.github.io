      I switched to Vim as my primary programming text editor about six months ago. While I'm really not very good with it yet--part of the attraction was the steep learning curve; I could still be training myself to use it more effectively years from now--I grew accustomed to it quickly enough that I wanted to use vi keybindings everywhere else in my OS (currently macOS).

      <p>
      So I decided to figure out a way to make this happen and, at least for now, narrowed the scope to creating a key binding that would switch the OS to another 'mode' where I could then work with text using very basic vi normal mode controls. The 'default' OS mode would then become the equivalent of vi's insert mode.
