Hi!

I'm Taylor. I write things (some fiction, some poetry--but mostly non-fiction thoughts here), record music, and as of recently make software (or, I'm at least learning to, bit by bit). This is a pretty standard-issue personal blog--about whatever I'm interested in at the moment--as well as a place to consolidate projects.

Maybe I'll add a photo soon if I'm feeling generous.

Here's some other places you can find me:
