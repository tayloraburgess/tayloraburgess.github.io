Hi! I'm Taylor.

I write things (some fiction, some poetry--but mostly non-fiction thoughts on this blog); write, record, and play music; and as of recently make software/program/code things (whichever expression [bothers you the least](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-programming-and-coding-4), I'll take). Or--at absolute minimum, I'm learning to do these things, bit by bit, and I'm loving the process.

This is a pretty standard-issue personal blog, covering whatever I'm interested in at the moment. I also use it to link to projects of various kinds that I've finished or am working on.

Who knows--maybe I'll even add a photo here soon.
