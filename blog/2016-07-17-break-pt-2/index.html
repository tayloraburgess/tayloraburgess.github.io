      <p>One of the potential benefits I see in forcing myself to blog (somewhat) daily while at Recurse is the ease with which I can identify the ways I'm prone to deceive myself about my work habits.</p>
      <p>For example, in my last post here, I said "[I planned] to spend this weekend working a lot." Did I do that? Not really at all. I also thought and said similar things about my first weekend here. And--surprise!--I also spent that weekend doing nothing programming-related (and feeling bad about it). So an obvious emerging pattern is that I probably like to work on weekdays and relax and prepare during the weekends--far from a revolutionary productivity cycle.</p>
      <p>But what's interesting about the experimental design of the Recurse Center is that no one is in any way forcing me to adhere to that schedule. And, when I pay attention to that chattering, critical voice in my head--which most people seem to have, in my experience--that wants to constantly tell me the type of person that I think I am or want to be, it's usually saying that I don't need rest days, and am some kind of unrealistically Herculean workhorse who breaks through personal milestones like papier-mâché and doesn't adhere to societal structures, like workweeks, that hem in my boundless creativity. Or something similarly delusional.</p>
      <p>But time and experience and the helpful thought log of these posts are all already making it clear that I have rhythms I naturally fall into that keep me moving and happy, and I should treat those patterns and myself with respect.</p>
      <p>In short: this weekend I spent plenty of time outside, went to an algorave, did things with friends, and, excepting a good sprint on Friday spent working on the markdown interpreter, didn't produce much code. And while in future Recurse weeks I may seize my weekends more productively, I'm learning not to give myself too hard of a time when I do exactly the opposite of that.</p>
      <p>Stray thoughts:</p>
      <ul class="break section-padding">
        <li>All of the above said, I'm planning to experiment with some alternative work cycles while I'm at RC and have the freedom to do so. Adrien hosted a "productivity day" today based around the <a href="http://www.personalhackathon.com">personal hackathon</a> model, and while I didn't go this time, I'm curious what focused cycles of compressed work could do for my projects.</li>
        <li>Other non-programming things from the weekend: American Museum of Natural History, Chinatown exploration, and the most essential New York experience of them all--the Ikea ferry.</li>
