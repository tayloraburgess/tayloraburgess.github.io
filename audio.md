This is a short discography of completed audio recordings I've worked on. Some are my own music, but a few are for other clients. I'm hoping to take on new projects and grow this list. 

If you hear anything interesting and want to discuss a project you'd like me to join in some capacity--which, if I've never met you, would frankly be a first for my audio work so far, but awesome--[get in touch](mailto:tayloraburgess@gmail.com).
