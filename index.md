Hi! I'm Taylor. ([Say hello.](mailto:tayloraburgess@gmail.com)) I'm currently based in New York, and I:

- [Write](/blog/) words (some fiction, some poetry--but mostly just blog here)
- [Record](/audio/) and [play](http://presssounds.bandcamp.com/) music
- [Program/code/make](https://github.com/tayloraburgess) software (whichever expression [bothers you the least](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-programming-and-coding-4), I'll take). 

(At minimum, I'm learning to do these things, bit by bit, and I'm loving the process.)

I'm also part of the current batch at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/). If you'd like to spend three months in NYC working with brilliant (and warm) programmers from around the world, consider applying.
