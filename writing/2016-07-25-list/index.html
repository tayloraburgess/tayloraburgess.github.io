      <p>I'm going to continue holding to the daily post standard to guilt myself into writing anything at all, but it's high time I acknowledge that I haven't kept to that schedule even through one complete week at the Recurse Center. Much like other parts of life, I think it's best to confront failure to live up to your own standards (preferably publicly, like, say, on a blog), so this is my attempt.</p>
      <p>That said, I've been constantly active with programming, so probably not worth faulting myself too much for sliding in one area while focusing intently on another. Here's what I've done over the past week or so, during which I apparently haven't found the time to blog:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Inched closer to completing the parser (which has proven to be by far the most challenging piece) for the <a href="https://github.com/tayloraburgess/markdown-preview">markdown interpreter/compiler</a>. Currently still wading through some block-level whitespace-interpreting swamps (working with things like this damn list, for example). When I've finished this project, I'll probably write a blog post about how <em>not</em> to design an interpreter for lightweight syntax.</li>
        <li>Began pairing with Leeor on the skeleton of a finance-tracking <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a> app. Trying to implement some of the functionality and trend-tracking features that I've cobbled together on my own absurdly overextended chain of personal finance Google Sheets (probably also worth a blog post at some point). Picking up some jQuery and other very basic frontend skills for the project, as well diving into databases via Postgres.</li>
        <li>Making progress with Casey &amp; Arpith on the <a href="https://github.com/elenacaseyroby/YoutubeMusicLib">YouTube music library/recommendation service</a> (as of writing, mostly just the library). We're still implementing Last.fm API calls, restructuring the backend MySQL database to better hold the data we pull down, and researching machine learning algorithms to feed all of that into to generate related songs and artists.</li>
        <li>Restructured the <a href="https://github.com/lamarqua/Woog">"Woog"</a> synthesizer with Adrien to more closely resemble VCO modules on certain classic polyphonic synthesizers. Obviously, limiting voices and routing individual oscillators as if they're physical units isn't necessary in the slightest for a MIDI-controlled synth that runs in a browser--but it's for the love of the game. Or something.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Stray thoughts:</p>
      <ul class="break section-padding">
        <li>Another possible explanation for lack of scheduled blogging--since I feel the need to compulsively apologize to no-one--is the consistent satisfaction I've been getting from just simple, structured work (even if I define that structure). It's been quite a while since I've left my bed (or Japanese futon on the floor, but who's checking) every day with a strong sense of purpose. (Even on weekends.) The rhythm of productivity and regular, solid social time with friends both old and new has left me with a lot less angst to dump on the internet.</li>
        <li>On the most minor note yet, I've discovered a small but reliable set of cheap eats around RC that generally stave off hunger for &lt;= $5 per meal. The caveat? Most are greasy and vegetable-free--dumplings, Halal carts, etc--so the current debate is whether to cave to the fiscal and temporal convenience of (totally great) New York dive-y food on a daily basis, or work a bit harder, bring my own meals, and be a better/healthier person. Not a problem I anticipated having, but here we are.</li>
